# Course-Crossover - MUSE-359

One of the main frustrations I’ve had with school (especially after coming back from co-op) was the tendency in most all of 
  my classes to remain sitting in a dropbox on mycourses, never to be used or looked at again. This in combination with the 
  lack of free time accompanying taking a full classload and a part time job tend to make it very difficult to pursue and 
  succeed at contributing to open source projects and developing new ideas.

The second half of this class has been a superb _counter_-example to this, and has afforded me the ability to develop upon 
  and even begin implementing larger ideas than I’d first anticipated. While the idea and organization existed before
  project 2 began, being able to overlap/double-count time spent towards this project and time spent working on open source 
  software for libraries has allowed me to pursue a passion and resolution while simultaneously fulfilling a requirement, 
  which was very valuable to me. The extra academic push also pushed me further towards looking into the scholarly side, and
  brought me to understand a bit more of the scholarly background underlying LIS that I hadn’t had much experience with 
  previously.

Tracking alongside my fellow classmates as they worked on projects in omeka, history pin, and wordpress also afforded me 
  valuable experience with various programs I might use later on in implementing other sites, as well as important user 
  feedback I may use in crafting my own or working on proprietary systems down the line. Moreover, the readings and class 
  discussions about digital heritage presenting the theory, examples, and technologies were very helpful and relevant, and 
  provided me with new information on where I may want to work and what I may want to work on out of college.

In a way that perhaps wasn’t entirely intended, posting the content we’ve created to multiple sites in multiple locations 
  along has also highlighted the importance of interoperability and preservation within and between technologies and systems. 
  From posting content simultaneously to mycourses and drupal in project 1, to importing and exporting data to Omeka, to 
  posting these very entries to both the RIT Muse and our personal sites, the course has been filled with examples of how 
  content can be duplicated in its exhibition. 
  
An important consideration for my future work in LIS software, spurred on by these experiences, will be how to maintain a 
  single, preservation copy of a variety of different types of content on a multiplicity of user-facing applications and 
  updating them all at once.

Coming away from this course, unlike many of my others, I’ll be able to leave not just with head knowledge, but with practical 
  experience, and the beginnings of a codebase and web presence for a project of mine I had difficulty finding time for 
  previously.

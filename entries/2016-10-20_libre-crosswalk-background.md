Quite thankfully, I was permitted to craft my own project to cover the planned projects 2 and 3. After considering various 
  options, I centered on a hybrid digitization and extension of the infamous Getty Crosswalk.

One of the main challenges in the the Library and Information Sciences is the variety and compatibility of various metadata 
  schemas, file types, standards, implementations, both within and across the various heritage institutions. A common way of 
  bridging this gap for catalogers has been through the use of “crosswalks” – large tables comparing and organizing the 
  various standards to a common set of rows relating back to their .

While an immense achievement and an incredibly valuable tool for catalogers making one to one translations between any two 
  columns of in the table, the Getty Crosswalk is limited and clunky as a single reference due to its size and complexity. It 
  also has the problem of being very difficult to apply flexibly or en masse, and a particular challenge to add to, as it is 
  centralized in the Getty Institution and not in the fullest sense “open source.”

I created lib-re/crosswalk as a way to address these issues and, in turn, to drastically simplifying the daily maintenance 
  tasks of deduplication, combination, and translation taking up an immense amount of the hours spent in digital asset 
  management. When the project is completed, it should afford the ability for the user to translate and combine multiple 
  records from various files, encodings, schemas, and standards into a single record in any format, instead of manually 
  analyzing the fields and deleting or overwriting potentially valuable metadata.

Another thing that my crosswalk affords is the ability for me to play around with the possible integration between the 
  various institutions’ metadata standards into one singular representative form. While I’ll elaborate more on that in the 
  next post (lib-re/crosswalk – information architecture), I recognized that there are many scenarios in which the same object, 
  item, or record is used, described, and passed between Libraries, Archives, Museums, Galleries, and Publishers.

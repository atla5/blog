## Introduction

In a previous post (lib-re/crosswalk – background), I gestured at a sort of shared metadata object built to contain 
  information from a variety of schemas, standards, and even institutions, as a sort of transmittable aggregate, 
  representative of a single ontological entity.

In this post, I’ll begin to expound on this idea and attempt to elucidate how to rationalize this 
  ontologically/epistemologically sound aggregate-view of description through the differing lenses of each LAM institution.

Libraries, Archives, and Museums have a non-disjoint (overlapping) set of descriptive, administrative, and structural 
  metadata that both inter-relate and inter-describe, and which are entirely unique to the nature of the institution. 
  This constitutes, overall, a differing sort of epistemology (manifested as the selective attention upon different 
  characteristics and uses of the same item) for each institution.
  
Such a descriptive framework, specifying and purpose-built around these differences, would more accurately situate the metadata 
  created in a semantic and traceable way, while facilitating the transfer between the central institutions.

## Library, Archives, and Museum Perspectives

Library-style catalog descriptions need to be technical, objective, and granular. They often relate directly to external 
  sources and controlled vocabularies external to the organization such as authority control, subject headings, and 
  publication addresses. Moreover, most library descriptions very often pertain to specific volumes, editions, and 
  implementations of other works and must clarify the type (born-digital, digitized, hardback, paperback, microfilm, etc) 
  of representation and relationship to the “original” work.

The longevity, physicality, and focus on accessibility entailed in the archival project demand that more attention be 
  given to extent, format, preservation/condition, location, and access. The unique aspect of Museums is the narrative 
  conception central to its goal of exhibiting items from potentially different collections to a certain audience. These 
  unique information needs add a variety of interpretive and relational complexity within and between records.

## Shared Ontology

Though each institution’s mission and operative/interpretive lens rightfully differ, a great amount of context and 
  description can be salvaged if the ontological singularity of the object they all described was recognized, embraced, 
  and preserved. 
  
It’s my belief that creating a singular representative “master record” as an aggregate of each component part could not only 
  systematize the use of differing records within a singular context, but provide a sensible and value-added means of 
  shifting contexts as they pass between institutions.

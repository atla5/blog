While slightly buzzword-y, and stubbornly unable to adequately and consistently [define itself](http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/),
  the field of digital heritage and humanities is a fascinating one with an incredibly bright future. The capacity for developing 
  technologies to bring a newfound vitality to today’s institutional collections is incredibly vast and exciting, as is the 
  potential for opening up entirely new fields of scholarship.

Institutions such as the [Smithsonian Institute](https://www.si.edu/), [local projects](https://localprojects.net/), and countless 
  others have been able to incorporate digital technologies and archival material into novel experiences otherwise unimaginable. 
  
In so doing, they’ve been able to establish new forms of user-content interaction that has drastically assisted in the description, 
  accessibility, and relevance of the collections they’ve leveraged.

Users (patrons) and administrators/managers (staff) alike have been able to add and extract this value through the power of crowdsourcing 
  ([transcription project](https://transcription.si.edu/)), social interaction communicating interest and interpretive importance 
  (Cleveland Museum of Art [collection wall(http://www.clevelandart.org/gallery-one/collection-wall)), and free publishing and open 
  access (wikimedia). 
  
  I believe the improved workflows and invigorated relevance of these collections this technology has afforded will have a tremendous 
    effect on the profession and the culture within my lifetime, and even the next decade.

# Assisted Living Archiving #

## Idea ##

#### short ####
Have a resident archivist go around to different assisted living facilities
  creating an archive about each of the residents before they pass on.

#### long ####
Organize a collection of photos, music, voice recordings of interviews and
  questions, objects, ephemera, etc. for the elderly to collect their ideas,
  opinions, personal history, thoughts about the future, etc. Share this archive
  with the loved ones, and host on a collected site with the names anonymized.

Through the course of doing this over time, and with a consistent format and
  procedure, you can develop a really interesting collection of how lives,
  ideas, and events inter-relate and a valuable and meaningful relic for loved
  ones.

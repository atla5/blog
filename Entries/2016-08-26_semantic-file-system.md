## Introduction

Current file organization on PC, Mac, and Linux (at least Ubuntu) and even on Google Drive and other cloud-based systems, 
  is singular and hierarchical in a very limiting in a rather intensely physical way. Determining the semantic structure of 
  your file system often requires you to specify a singular genus/differentia upon which to classify the materials you want to save
  (e.g. academic year, general subject, individual course).

While Mac (and many third party add-ons) offer(s) a tremendous added efficiency and flexibility with enabling tagging and search,
  the predominant 'location' of your file is fixed to a single place in a directory, and needn't be. It is sensible to imagine 
  an interface in which the 'location' of a given file is contingent upon the currently selected 'criteria' of arrangement, or the 
  given 'view'. 
  
In a very basic example, if I'm looking for a piece of project work from a course taken in my undergraduate, I may have organized it
  by year > semester > course, by subject > topic > complexity (intro, depth), by item-type (project, notes, test) > context > course, etc. We can see 
  that these alternative arrangements would overlap, drastically differ, and yet, not compete and their rationale may be based 
  on the current informational need or available information.

## Background

Stimulated, I'm sure, by my juxtaposed study of in Cultural Informatics (MUSE-359) and Archival Studies (MUSE-340), of 
  software engineering as a whole, and of my work at Wallace Library, is a growing realization of a distinction between the 
  complete objective identity of an object and the organizational/
  
  
## Objectivity

The singular "file location" - while understandably skeuomorphic (placing a _file_ in a given _folder_ on your _desk_-top) - 
  inappropriately leverages both the power of computing technology and of the human mind, while already preventing a "false"
  abstraction from the physical arrangement of data in bits on the machine. 
    
Computationally/physically, in the example of the traditional HDD drive, your file is _"really"_ located in enumerate segments
  all over a disk spinning at 7200 mph [tomsguide](http://www.tomsguide.com/answers/id-2656423/average-hdd-read-write-speed.html).
  
Objectively/philosophically, we form abstractions (or just 'groupings' here) by locating certain 'features' or _attributes_ which 
  each object (objectively) has in common, whether in kind, measure, form, etc. (whether categorically (all 'blue'), temporally (same semester), topically, or otherwise).
  Often, (perhaps always), the selection of this differentiating criteria is determined by the subjective practical context of the 
  individuals purpose/goal, training/disposition, mindset/mood, current cognitive load. 
  
...
  
## Conclusions 
 
This is just to say that:
  1) there are a multitude of ways to _optimally_ categorize the same objects 
  2) the "value" (grade of efficiency/desirability) of each created classification schema is non-static (even while remaining objective)
  3) the classification used is subjectively conditioned by the operational context of, and even the specific individual herself, grouping them 
  4) this dynamic quality is applicable not only _between_ individuals, but within contexts or purposes _of_ the individual (user)
  5) objectivity of each classification/grouping is contingent upon subjective state, but remains objectively determin_ed_ and determin_able_
  6) the determinability of one's classification is both "subjective" (state, goal, context) and potentially programmatically anticipated.
  7) while a given context will be objectively superior to another, there is a non-zero cost to switching between them

From a user experience standpoint, then:
  1) a system which restricts the user to one form of classificational hierarchy unnecessarily restricts and frustrates the user's goals
  2) there must be a way to change or switch between the lenses by which the user is forming their abstraction
  3) there is no singular dominant 'view' to default to (other than one which may be temporally or statistically dominant [used most often])
  4) it is insufficient to couple together a 'view' with a given 'user profile' (1-to-1 mapping between user and view)
  5) the predictability of one 'view' is hypothetically predictable, reliant upon an understanding/anticipation of user 'state', goal, or context of use
  6) via the user input, contextual cues, or recurring/habitual behaviors, the system may be able to anticipate a user's 'current' optimal view
  7) unnecessary view or context-switching should be avoided, and optimal view selection balanced by activation energy.
  
Which suggests:
  1) the current organizational file system is actively harming productivity or otherwise optimal user experience
  2) the optimal file system hierarchy must be alterable/adaptable/configurable/dynamic
  3) there should be more than one configuration available 
  4) a single user must be able to swap between them at will
  5) systems can be put in place to _suggest_ certain views, even beyond a 'default'
  6) system does not necessarily need to await current-time input on user, but should support 
    - user setting a pre-set schedule/rules 
    - user override or configuration of suggestions 
    - ...
  7) switching should be deliberate, noticeable, and not overwhelmingly frequent
  
## Practicality/Efficiencies

In terms of _user_ efficiencies, I'd expect such a system to outcompete the traditional systems in terms of time taken to 
  locate a file or the reliability with which old files are obtained on search. This being said, conscious attention given 
  to context switching is difficult/requires specific attention/input, and the removal of the physical affordances of placing 
  an object in a given geographic location is not to be underestimated. 
  
In terms of computational effectiveness and implementation, I currently have little to no idea. A configurable calendar/context-based
  state machine or even a configuration engine placed between the user and a common file look up could be unnecessarily burdensome
  and noticeable waittimes for users pre/viewing may not be tolerated (with good reason). 
  
The fractional efficacies gained from placing configuration and conscious attention to a task most users find simple,
  non-problematic, and commonly understood might be ill-advised, especially given the tremendous power of modern search. I rather 
  doubt that many people other than super users would take full advantage of this feature (as it could easily get confusing and return 
  little net benefit when totally summed up), but it would be very easily default into the traditional behavior and build from there. 

## Additional Benefits

A tremendous value could be gained from formalizing the nature of the relation between these lenses or views, particularly relating 
  to the semantic inter-relation of different digital 'objects' along these specified criteria. While many of these could be 
  arrived at blindly ("tends to use __ view during __ class scheduled at __ time on calendar"), their potential usefulness in 
  contextualizing the information and suggesting the mindset of the user at different times/locations could be very interesting.
